# visual-marks.nvim

A Neovim plugin to display marks in the signcolumn.

When you add a visual mark, for instance `a` by pressing `ma`, the letter `a` appears in the signcolumn to the left of your Neovim window, making it easier to see and remember where you placed your marks for jumping from one point to another in your document.
